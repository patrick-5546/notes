Once the steep learning curve is overcome, coding becomes much faster. However Vim is primarily a text editor and does not natively support the features expected from a full IDE. On the other hand, VS Code supports debugging, remote development, Git, and much more through extensions. To get the best of both world's I connect a Vim backend to a VS Code frontend using VS Code's Neovim extension. Rather than emulating Vim functionality like other extensions do, this extension communicates with the Neovim executable. The disadvantage of emulation is performance and functionality that is dependent on its developers implementing them. That is not to say that I don't use Vim/Neovim by itself at all.
