# Patrick's Notes

Welcome to my personal notes, where I am free to rant about whatever I want :smile:.
I have big plans for this website, though I'm not sure if I have the time to match :sweat_smile:;
for a sneak peak, check out the open issues of the corresponding repository.

I created this website to:

1. Consolidate all my resources and references in one place. I just hate it when I recognize an error
message but forget how I resolved it. Or when I revisit a tool and have to relearn how it works.
Thus, I plan to record what I learn here while it is fresh in my memory.

2. Further my understanding of what I learn by writing it in my own words. This improves learning
retention and serves as a resource that I can use to refresh my memory.

3. Build skills related to software development, including Git, CI/CD, iterative development, and documentation.

4. Inspire and guide others to take advantage of the powerful capabilities of popular coding-related software.
