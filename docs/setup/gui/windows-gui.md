# Windows GUI

Some of my favorite Windows GUI applications include:

- [Bitwarden](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients): password manager that has apps for all my devices
- [Komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi): tiling window manager
- [Microsoft To Do](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/microsoft-to-do-list-app): task management; I especially like the "My Day" list
- [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/): email client, as Outlook doesn't play nice with Gmail
- [NanaZip](https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip): file archiver with a modern UI, forked from 7-Zip
- [OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app): note taking, whether typed, handwritten, or annotated
- [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/): video player with powerful features that can play any type of video
- [WizTree](https://diskanalyzer.com/): quick and visual disk space analyzer
