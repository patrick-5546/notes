# General Interview Preparation

!!! quote ""
    Prepare as much beforehand, as the time between being selected and the interview date could be less than a week

## Before being selected

### Prepare for questions about resume experiences

For each technical experience on your resume, ensure that the source code is easily accessible with documentation and diagrams.
For example, push it to a GitHub repository (making it private if required).
This is helpful when explaining technical details during an interview

Next, prepare for common interview questions related to your experiences:

- **Describe a time when you had a conflict when working on a team, and how you resolved it**
    - I have been asked this many times
- Tell me about yourself
    - Come up with a couple responses for different types of jobs
- Describe a problem that you solved
- Describe your process for debugging code
- Describe a leadership experience

Good topics to practice talking about include:

- Collaborating with colleagues to find the best possible solution
    - Receptive to feedback and varying perspectives
    - Each person has different strenghts
- Bottom up approach - reusability, test each small part
- Besides performance, consider reliability, sustainable, and reparability

### Prepare for open-ended technical questions

    It is more important to be able to clearly explain your ongoing thought process than to solve the problem

Use the STAR method:

- Think about the inputs and outputs

Action

- Demonstrate logical thinking
    - Give initial thoughts, broad overview
    - Subdivide into different parts
- Devise initial solution
- Walkthrough with a simple example to verify correctness
- Think about potental optimizations

Results

- Test final solution
- Ask for feedback, or what they would do, and discuss from there

### Gain interview experience

- Any interview practice is good practice
    - Apply to as many positions as possible
    - Talk with professors about research opportunities
    - Make an appointment with your co-op advisor
    - Ask a friend
- Explain technical experiences so that even people not in the industry can follow
- Practice on-the-spot thinking; connect your answers with relevant experiences

## After being selected

### Study job requisites

Be able to explain them in your own words and relate to your past experiences.

### Prepare for position-specific questions

- Why do you want to work for the company/team/position?
    - Research reputation, work culture, products/services, etc.
- Prepare questions for your interviewer intended to
    - Help decide if the position is right for you
    - Demonstrate your enthusiasm and passion for the company/position and its products

#### Position-specific technical questions

Places where you can find past/common interview questions include:

- Past or current employees and interns
- Glassdoor
- Reddit
- LeetCode
- Cracking the Coding Interview
- My hardware and software Reference and Questions pages briefly go over the content covered and questions asked in my past interviews
    - They are intended as a way to review and gauge your knowledge rather than to learn new topics
