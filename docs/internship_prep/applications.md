# Applications

My application strategy is to prepare as much as I can before companies start posting so that:

1. The time it takes to apply for each position is minimized
2. Whenever an interview opportunity arises, I am prepared

In economic terms, my strategy has a high upfront cost, but minimal recurring costs.

## Resume

!!! quote ""
    How your experiences and achievements make you the best candidate for the position

### Technical skills

- Copy vocabulary from job descriptions
- Organize skills into groups (i.e., languages, hardware, tools/frameworks)

### Experiences

- 3-point structure
    1. Overview/context/ of the experience
    2. Result/achievement (ideally quantitative)
    3. What you specifically did/learned
- [Recruiters don't look at a resume very long, and often read in an F-pattern](https://www.hrdive.com/news/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/541582/)
    - Clear sections and headers
    - Concise sentences
    - Phrase sentences so that keys words are at the beginning

### Length

- 1-page for larger companies, 2-page for smaller companies
- Cutting experiences: consider relevance to the position and similarity to other experiences
    - Can put everything on LinkedIn and link to your profile in the resume
- Padding experiences: consider mentioning transferrable soft skills
    - For example, Agile methodologies, proactive/self-motivated nature, leadership, communication, documentation
- If you don't have many relevant experiences, considering adding sections on work/volunteer experience and non-technical interests to differentiate yourself from other applicants

## Cover Letter

!!! quote ""
    Quick to write, yet high quality & personalized

### Format

1. Introduction
    - Passion for role
    - Passion for company products/services/achievements/work culture
    - Mention personal contacts and other interactions with the company you have had
    - General statement about what makes you a good fit
        - Include vocabulary from the job description
2. Body
    - Describe relevant experience using the START technique
        - Situation - scene and context
        - Task - goal
        - Action - what you specifically did
        - Result - achievement (make quantitative if possible), what you learned
        - Transfer - how what you learned can be used in the position you are applying for
3. Conclusion
    - Thank the hiring committee for their time
    - Include how they can arrange an interview

### Create templates

To reduce the time it takes to write a cover letter,
prepare a template for each type of position you want to apply to:

- Testing
- Web/Mobile Application Development
- Data Analyst
- Gaming
- Hardware
- DevOps/Infrastructure/Site Reliability
- Robotics/Controls

These templates will vary in the experience they describe in the body paragraph
and maybe also in the terms used in the introduction general statement.

## Job Search

!!! quote ""
    Manage your time effectively

### Gather information

- Attend info sessions, workshops
- Reach out to people working at the company
    - Managers, recruiters, staff, interns
    - Learn about the industry, company, and their personal experiences
    - Ask them about open positions and referrals
    - Mention them in your cover letter

### Stay organized, analyze results, iteratively improve

I kept track of my applications using Notion: [Applications List Example](https://patrick5546.notion.site/7045ba417e5c43b3ad340f7f995779b4?v=50cd8dcbe9e2466b8c73f1bd9fa9772c).
I use it to analyze the results of previous applications in order to determine which positions I should apply to next.
For example, if I see that I did not have much success applying to positions with greater than *#* applicants,
or that require *xxxx* skills, I would avoid applying to similar types of jobs in the future,
or revise my resume and cover letter to strengthen those areas.
