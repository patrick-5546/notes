# Hardware Questions

I have listed some hardware technical questions that were asked in my interviews at Intel, Microchip, Qualcomm, and Microsoft below.
With the academic and extracurricular experience to be a candidate for more technical positions when seeking my second internship,
the average question difficulty rose accordingly.
The answers to some of these questions can be found in the [Hardware Reference](./hw_reference.md) page.

## Seeking my first internship

- Difference between a latch and DFF
- Difference between a Mealy and Moore FSM
- Implement gates (AND, NOR, etc.) from 2:1 multiplexers
- Create a DFF with reset from a regular DFF

## Seeking my second internship

- Draw and compare the waveforms for a latch and DFF
- How to select between a Mealy and Moore FSM
- Implement a buffer and inverter from a NAND or XOR gate
- Implement DFFs (synchronous and asynchronous reset, enable) and latch in Verilog
- Different types of power dissipation
- Different types of adders
- Hardware multiplication and alternatives
- One hot vs binary FSM state encodings
- Causes of inferred latches
- Applications of latches
- Causes and fixes for setup and hold time violations
- Causes and fixes for clock domain crossings; metastability
- Gray code applications
- SystemVerilog vs Verilog
    - Purpose of for loops in SystemVerilog
- Transistors
- RC circuits
- Clock jitter, skew
- Setup and hold slack
- Draw a state machine diagram of an elevator (more details about the elevator's functionality were given)
