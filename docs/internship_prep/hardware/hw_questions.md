# Hardware Interview Questions

- Implement buffer and inverter from XOR
- NOR from 2:1 multiplexers
- AND from 2:1 mux
- NOT from NAND
- reset flip flop from flop
- Implement flip flop (synch and asynch reset, enable) and latch in Verilog
    - latch vs flop waveform
- Power dissipation: static (leakage) when current is idle, dynamic when current is switching
- Multiply: expensive, so add or shift
- Mealy vs Moore (use Mealy in practice)
- One hot vs binary state encodings
    - One hot requires more flops, but simplifies next state and output logic
- Inferred latch occurs when not all combinations of input logic are defined
- Setup violation → metastable, hold time → lose previous data
    - How to solve hold time violation (buffer on data or clock path, increase gate delays - increase drive strength or threshold voltage, c→q time)
- Clock domain crossing: synchronize, metastability MTBF
- Gray code applications: glitch, cdc
- For loop in systemverilog increases readability
- Latch only application: clock gating (if clk past input to output)
- RC circuits
- Different types of adders
- State machine diagram of an elevator
- Clock jitter (absolute difference of clock edge from ideal caused by noise), skew (arrives at different flops at different times), slew (transition rate)
- Setup and hold slack
