# Internship Preparation Process

My notes on how to efficiently apply for internships and prepare for interviews,
as well as topics covered in interviews that I have done.
It is intended to be more of a supplementary than comprehensive resource,
perhaps giving you a couple ideas on how to improve your own preparation process.

If you have any questions for me, please don't hesitate to reach out.
