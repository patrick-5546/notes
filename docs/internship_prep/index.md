# Internship Preparation Process

My notes on how to efficiently apply for internships and prepare for interviews,
as well as topics covered in interviews that I have done.
It is intended to be more of a supplementary than comprehensive resource,
perhaps giving you a couple ideas on how to improve your own preparation process.

If you have any questions for me, please don't hesitate to reach out.

## Credits

- A lot of my internship preparation notes have come from discussions that I have had with [Roger Luo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-sichen-luo/)
- Most of my [Hardware Reference](./hardware/hw_reference.md) notes were written when I was studying for the [CPEN 311](https://ece.ubc.ca/courses/cpen-311/) final
